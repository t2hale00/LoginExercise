# Login Form Exercise

This exercise project is a simple login form app created as an exercise to practice building user interfaces with Jetpack Compose. The app focuses on creating a visually appealing login screen without implementing actual login functionality.
The app was made using Kotlin and Android Studio. This exercise project is done to complete Mobile Programming with Native Technologies course.

## 

### Task Description

The exercise involves creating a basic UI with required fields for username and password. The app does not perform actual login validation or execution upon pressing the submit button.

### Key Points

- **Basic UI Implementation:** The initial implementation focuses on creating a clean and functional UI for the login form.

- **State Variables:** While state variables for username and password are implemented, their values are not required or used, as the app does not perform actual login.

- **Styling Parameters:** Various styling parameters such as color, textAlign, fontSize, etc., are utilized to modify the appearance of Text components.

- **Keyboard Options:** Proper keyboard options are set for outlined text fields, specifically for email and password entry.

- **Modifiers:** Modifiers are used to define width, padding, etc., for components, ensuring a visually balanced layout.

- **Icons for Text Fields:** Icons are added to text fields to enhance the user interface. 

- **Password Field Display:** The password field is modified to display "dots" instead of actual characters using VisualTransformation.
